  <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
  <p>
    My intended outcomes for this course are clearly split into two parts. The long term ambition for me is that I would like to make games,
    either for a small studio or just for myself. I'm not terribly motivated by money (partly due to the privilege of not ever wanting
    for it in my life, partly due to complete disillusionment in capitalism), so my short term goal is to get a job doing something
    that affords me the flexibility to work while still pursuing music, which is my original passion. In some ways it feels dishonest
    doing this course, as I have no real ambition or desire to be a web developer. This course is definitely a stepping stone for me,
    but I know my reasons for going this route and I stick by them.
  </p>

  <p>
    My biggest weakness in all of this will be, I think, my lack of effective time management. A lot of the pitfalls that have already been 
    laid out in this course are things I frequently suffer from; particularly getting sucked down rabbit holes, but also more generic
    issues with procrastination. This means that I don't necessarily handle being left responsible for my own learning to this degree.
    However, one thing I am very confident in is my ability to stick to commitments that I make to others. I will not allow myself to let
    other people down, and that includes not only my peers who may be counting on me for a team project, but also the facilitators and
    teachers who are putting trust in me to follow through. These are things I take increidbly seriously, and that will be what guides
    my decision making in all this.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before this course began I made a speculative daily calendar to block out my time effectively, but this was built on some guesses
    about the workload that turned out to be inaccurate, and so I kind of abandoned it. However this week has shown me that it's definitely
    still something that I need guiding me, and so I will be revisiting and adjusting that to serve as a template for my time spent
    studying at home. Once Bootcamp starts I am already committed to spending as much time as I can at the facilities, as my past 
    experience has shown me I learn best by creating a physically distinct space free of distractions, and my living situation simply
    doesn't allow that at present. I have set aside the full time of the course to be as free of any other schedule conflicts, although
    there is always the slight chance of a gig opportunity I have to take (but even that is usually something that can fit around
    pretty easily); this is pretty unlikely at the moment though (lol).
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm very lucky to have an incredible support base of friends, family and my partner to call on when I start feeling overwhelmed.
     I also have a good friend who did the course last year, and who has been an incredible help in getting me this far. I also know 
     a couple of the facilitators, and the ones I've met since do the course I also feel very comfortable talking to. This is important 
     because one of the things I know I'm also not great with (and that I want to improve as well) is making friends with people. I'm 
     not necessarily uncomfortable talking to new people or being friendly or open with them, but I think I need specific conditions for 
     that to happen naturally and being in a group chat doesn't really meet those conditions for me. I've really had to acknowledge this 
     in the past couple of weeks as I know I haven't been participating a great deal in the Slack comms, but it's something I want to work 
     on.
  </p>

  <p>
    So I've got my work cut out for me, but don't we all? I think if I can come out of this course with an improved sense of discipline 
    and scheduling ability, as well as the programming skills to continue and build on a potential career in coding somewhere (hopefully 
    gaming but maybe music tech or something else), that will be a real success. And I think I can do that.
  </p>

  <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
  
  <p>
    By all accounts, Bootcamp is a huge step up from Foundations, which in a lot of ways I'm really looking forward to. I think a lot of what I had heard about 
    Bootcamp I had also applied slightly erroneously to Foundations, and as such set my expectations for the level of challenge this early on a little high. Not 
    a bad problem on the whole, but I've done a lot of thinking around adjusting my expectations for the challenge based on what I've already learned as well 
    as what I know about the coming weeks. I'm feeling very confident in my ability to learn the coding skills needed to complete this course. However, I think 
    the biggest challenge for me will be maintaining my full engagement, both for my sake and for the sake of my cohort members who I will be collaborating with.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main reason for this being a concern for me is that I've realised over the course of Foundations that web design itself is not something I have a great 
    interest in pursuing, and that game design is something that I would be far more interested in as far as a career is concerned. This is something I have 
    thought about more than once in my life but for some reason (despite being comfortable with the idea of pursuing a music career) have always been fairly 
    dismissive of this as a pipe dream. I feel a lot less like that now, which is exciting, and more importantly I've found that diving into video game coding 
    during Foundations has actually helped give me more practice with a lot of the same concepts as what we have covered in the course (particularly the 
    Javascript stuff). Therefore, my goal going into the rest of the course is to maintain the utility of building this additional skillset, and to continue 
    looking for opportunities to start working in this industry, but also seek out other aspects of web design that might be of more interest (like building 
    apps etc).
  </p>

  <p>
    For me, something I know will guarantee ease of engagement and focus is having access to facilities. This is probably the biggest thing to support my 
    learning, and I am cogent of the fact that with the way things are right now that may not be possible for some period of time. I think the other thing I 
    would hope for in cases where I can't be in a space with other people learning is to have active ecnouragement to engage through the online channels 
    provided. I also acknowledge my own responsibility here, and I think this is another weakness of mine; I really love working with other people but I 
    find it very difficult (or more accurately, unintuitive) to do this online, and I've been really pushing myself to do more in this area.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, I have always gone into this course with the mindset that it would be a reasonably open-ended way for me to gain a new set of skills and open 
    up new employment opportunities for me, and I will always be committed to that goal. However, having spent some time in the course and learning more about 
    what exactly it's like has given me an additional commitment; to not allow myself to be distracted from the work at hand, and to be fully present and engaged 
    with the work and the people doing the work. For me, cooperation and collaboration are hugely important, so as long as I keep those things front and 
    centre I feel confident I will complete this course to a standard I can be proud of.
