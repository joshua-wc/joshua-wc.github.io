  <h4>Core Personal Values</h4>

  <p>
    The most recent major ethical decision I had to make was leaving my job. There were a number of reasons for doing this but the main catalyst was a couple of incidents that pointed to a broader cultural issue at the business; one case of an employee being sexually harassed by a customer (which nothing was really done about until I stepped in and talked to the customer, which didn’t happen for weeks), and being made aware of serious racism directed towards another employee who had already left by the time they told me. This was the final straw for me and I realised I could no longer continue working there in good conscience. Unfortunately, I couldn’t bring myself to tell them that was the reason (there were other reasons that were easier to point to). All of this had coincided with being encouraged to look at taking this course, so everything kind of aligned in a really convenient way for me. But I still wish I had been able to say something more honest about my reasons for leaving. It’s a hard one, because for the most part I think there are good people working at that place, with good values, who care about the idea of the enterprise enough to tough out the worse aspects of the culture. And as much as I think that the business deserves to be held publicly to account for their poor workplace culture, I didn’t feel comfortable making that decision for everyone who worked there. But if I’m honest with myself, the main reason I didn’t do that was because I fear conflict like the plague, and it does get in the way of my integrity sometimes.

  </p>

  <p>
    It’s funny, because I’m a New Zealand European man from a stable home, who mostly grew up in an affluent neighbourhood. A lot of the values I consider most important to me are at odds with my cultural background. I suppose in a lot of ways having to acknowledge and examine my privilege (I’m like a poster child for privilege) has done a lot for me as far as my values, but if I think about a lot of the things I consider most important (trust, integrity, commitment. equity) I already believed in those things before I started doing that. I think maybe what examining privilege has helped with is living in line with my values, because that’s the thing about values; having them and observing them are two different things. I know I was lucky and unique as far as a lot of my peers were in that I had parents who placed zero expectation on me as far as what I would do for myself, and whatever that ended up being (music, in my case) they were supportive of my pursuits. This gave me a huge amount of confidence and also gave me the space to get comfortable with self-examination, and holding myself to account. It does feel like a lot of my values arise almost in opposition to my culture though; a huge portion of my moral framework and belief system stems from anti-capitalist ideals and systems of thought. So things like community, equity, and openness to perspectives of other people (I have a real desire to understand why people think or feel the way they feel, usually with a goal to conflict resolution), all stem from an opposition to the way society has been structured.

  <h4>Strengths and Limitations</h4>

  <p>
    Having done some research and self-reflection, I can point to some strengths that would be particularly helpful in project-based professional scenarios. I’m good at conflict resolution and keeping the peace (mainly out of self-preservation, as above I can’t stand conflict). I’ve also given myself a pretty good track record of keeping my commitments and promises; if I say I’m going to do something for somebody, I will do it. I really hate letting people down in that way, so I take every step to avoid it. I also have an awful lot of confidence, both in myself and in other people. This means I’m rarely discouraged from trying things out or getting stuck into a project or problem even if I know it will stretch my capabilities and challenge me, with the potential for failure. Confidence in other people is, I think, even better, because it means I’m always excited to be doing something collaborative, and want as much input from everyone involved in something as I can possibly get. I kind of think every environment should be a learning environment, whether you’re at school or in a job or just working on a personal project. So all these skills are helpful in these situations. However I can see that some of them would help with specific learning obstacles. I can be quite self-absorbed in a way, and I’ve noticed this can often lead to insecurity or self-doubt manifesting, which is obviously fuelled pretty heavily when you are in confronting or challenging situations.However, I’ve developed a robust defense against this kind of mental chatter that’s buoyed up by my confidence. Being a peace-keeper is also a kind of defense mechanism for learning; I find it’s hard for anyone to learn any valuable lessons from an experience if the main take away is that someone made them furious.

  </p>

  <p>
    I would say some of my biggest limitations stem from an almost obstinate reluctance to follow a formalised schedule or time management system. I’d love to say that I have my own method for doing this, but that would be largely untrue. It is something I’m working on but it’s also something that has let me down in the past, and I can think of many situations where my lack of time management has prevented me from getting the most out of a learning opportunity. I’m also somewhat easily distracted, but not in the way many people are I think; I have a few interests that I value equally, and have all sorts of justifications for dividing my time among them even if something requires more of my attention at any given time. I also have found that I’ve developed something of an extreme mindset around changing my habits or forming new ones; I often decide that the only way to do this is not with gradual adjustments, but intense and violent shifts in direction. At this point this appears to not be very effective, and even if it was I doubt if it’s the healthiest way to approach this kind of thing.

  </p>

  <p>
    I went on tour two years ago and I found it incredibly difficult to work with the person whose project it was. I ended up having a reasonable role of responsibility in the touring party, and by the end of what totalled seven months spread across a year of touring I could barely speak to him. At the time I was trying to employ all the tools I had to avoid conflict and to keep things running in a way that was equitable and functional, but it was the most confronting professional situation I’d been in and it kind of railroaded me. I had this idea of myself that had been built up for years that I was a ‘chill guy’, who didn’t get rattled or anxious or upset by basically anything. And yet I was angry basically every day for large parts of the day, and was venting all the time in a pretty unhealthy way. I am proud of myself for what I was able to do, to keep that tour on the road (again, there were people involved who I did value and care about, and didn’t want them to suffer unnecessarily), and I don’t feel I had to sacrifice my values too much. But looking back now, the healthy thing to do would have been to leave that situation as soon as it became clear that this was going to be the way it was. It’s hard to have that perspective when you’re in a situation like that, but I would do things differently if I could do it again. I think I would have been firmer with my efforts to address the problems as I saw them, and would have removed myself when I felt that there was nothing more to try.
