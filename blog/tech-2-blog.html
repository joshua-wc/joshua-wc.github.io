      Class and ID are both examples of something called a selector, which is just a way of pointing to specific parts of your
      document that you want to apply particular styles to. They are similar in many ways, but not all!
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes are a broader label that you can share between different elements of your website, and so are best used when you
      want to apply consistent design rules across many different parts of your website, or even reuse certain elements 
      consistently across different pages within your website (like headers or footers, for example).
    </p>
    <p>
      IDs, on the other hand, can only be assigned to a single element, and are therefore most useful when you want to tweak
      the broad style rules for your page, but only for a particular part of the page. An ID will also override any class rules
      that apply to the element. IDs also have some additional functionality and can be interacted with via the Javascript of your page.
        
    </p>

    <p>Think of a sports team. A class is like the team's shirt, while an ID is like their shirt number! Both are helpful in identifying
      a player, but in different ways.
