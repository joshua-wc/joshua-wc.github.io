      I've discovered a couple of things about myself that I maybe suspected, but have now had confirmed unequivocally. One thing that was something of a surprise 
      is that my own belief in my open-mindedness and thoughtfulness was actually providing something of a barrier to practicing those things effectively; that 
      there is a state where self-awareness turns into self-mythologising, and it's very important to analyse not just your thoughts, but your actions as well. 
      Something even more surprising for me was the discovery that I've become quite dependent on traditional forms of achievement validation that I've learned 
      from my previous education experiences (particularly high school and university). Even music school, which I had maybe convinced myself was sufficiently 
      different from the 'standard' university experience, had reinforced this idea that I needed someone to tell me clearly if I was on the right track, or if 
      I had acheived what I was trying to. I also learned the true extent of my self-confidence, which makes me both happy and nervous (more happy than nervous). 
      It's a new thing for me to be more fully aware of, and use it to my advantage without allowing it to hamper me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think in a lot of ways things like self-awareness and empathy play the same role in programming and learning as they do in most other settings; they 
      allow us to engage in cooperative enterprise together (whether that be teaching a class or completing a coding project) while mitigating or eliminating the 
      risk for damage to people's self-esteem or relationships. Any cooperative endeavour can put strain on our ability to communicate and coexist, and it's 
      very important to have as much situational awareness as possible, and to have the skills to not only identify situations but to know what to do in them.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think what I found the most surprising about the core was also what I found most challenging about it; the fact that a lot of the focus seemed to be 
      centred around the utility of this in a purely professional setting. I understand why this is the case; this course is designed not only to teach you the 
      skills to do this job, but to get this job. However I personally found this hyper-focus on career utility a little bit of a turn-off, just because it 
      feels a little too capitalist for my taste. I appreciate that is probably not at the root of the intent, and also acknowledge that I am also engaging in 
      this for capitalist reasons; I want a job too. However I did find that it was sometimes creating a bit of resistance in me, and that maybe I was wasting 
      some time pushing back against things when really I should have been listening to what was being said, and making up my own mind about these things 
      (which is ultimately what I would be doing anyway). It makes complete sense that you would be teaching this to the extent that you are, as well; it's 
      obvious that the tech industry is one that is particularly concerned with fostering good culture in their work environments, and so purely from a job-seeking 
      perspective it is a very useful thing to be skilled at. But it's also the kind of thing that, even if you don't pursue a career in this at the end of 
      the course, will be hugely useful to you in your life whatever you end up doing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm glad this sort of thing is being taught, and I actually think it should be taught much earlier in people's lives. It's the kind of thing that is 
      very much taken for granted that people will simply figure it out on their own, and that nds up being true to an extent. But I feel every single one 
      of us would benefit hugely from some formal education in mindfulness and self-awareness and empathy, and being given meaningful tools to practice and 
      build on these skills throughout your life. I think the balance that has been struck here is good, and I think if there were improvements to be made 
      with how the technical stuff is being taught, there is room within the amount of time you've allocated for it to tweak and improve that process, without 
      taking time away from the Core curriculum.
