     HTML and CSS are two sides of the same blimp. The HTMl is the frame, the fabric, and the gas keeping it afloat. CSS is the huge advertisement in loud 
     colours and eye-popping fonts splashed across the front. But what if you want your advertisement to change based on the time of day? That's where
     Javascript comes in.
   </p>

   <p>
     Unfortunately, Javascript doesn't have anything to do inherently with web development, in the way that HTML and CSS do (contrary to what I said
     earlier, these are programming languages for websites, not engineering and graphic design tools). Javascript is a pretty powerful language that is 
     capable of a lot, but it doesn't intrinsically know what HTML or CSS is, let alone what they are talking about. That is where the DOM (Document 
     Object Model) steps in to bridge the gap. The DOM is a way for Javascript to understand the references that HTML and CSS are making. It's like a 
     translator that can convert things like classes, ids, or HTML elements into things that Javascript can understand and manipulate. It allows you to do 
     things like assign and alter values directly onto elements of your HTML or your CSS classes, and add events to them; so that when you click on a button,
     for example, the fundamental building blocks of your code can be altered!
   </p>

   <p>
     One of the most powerful tools Javascript has to exercise this kind of manipulation are things called functions. A function is basically a piece of 
     logic that can deliver instructions when the function is called, and these instructions can be conditional (that is, they will ony trigger if certain
     things are true, or a certain state is reached). The DOM has it's own set of default functions that you can use to do things like access HTML elements or 
     prevent the default behaviour of things like right-clicking on something, but you can write your own functions too! These functions are hugely flexible 
     in what you can accomplish, since you can set practically all of the parameters for them yourself, and make them as complex as you like; with conditions 
     branching off into limitless possible results as you run through the logic of your function sequentially.
   </p>

   <p>
     This idea of running through a function in order is what is known as control flow. Think about driving a car; an incredibly complex activity with a lot 
     of variable involved. Starting the car requires certain things to happen in the right order; firstly the car won't start if it has no fuel, or a dead 
     battery. Assuming those things aren't true, you have to activate the ignition to start the car, and then you're constantly adjusting the parameters of 
     steering, braking and accelarating as you move. As you head to your destination you will be in a kind of holding pattern until you need to make a change 
     in direction; you stay driving down the street you are on until you arrive at the street you next need to turn on to. This is kind of like something in 
     programming called a loop; where you cycle over a particular part of a function for an amount of time, until a particular threshold or condition is met. 
     Loops can be contained within functions, or they can be the whole function itself!
   </p>

   <p>
     Loops are particularly helpful for running through stacks of data very quickly. Javascript has two particular ways that it can store groups of data; 
     arrays and objects. On surface level they appear very similar, but for a couple of key differences. Arrays use square brackets, and look like this:

      var array = [4, 2, "hello", "world"] 
     
     Objects, on the other hand, use curly braces, and look more like this: 

     var object = {
       name: "josh",
       age: 25,
       isCool: true,
       bestFriend: "sunny"
     }

     Notice how the object  has it's data grouped in pairs, separated by a comma. These pairs 
     are know as a key:value pair, and these are the secret to an object's power. Both objects and arrays can be accessed by an indexing system. Arrays 
     use something called bracket notation, which would look like this:

     array[0]

     Because computers index beginning at 0 instead of 1, the first item of an array will always be [0], so this would give us the number 4 in our example. 
     Objects can also use bracket notation, as well as using something called dot notation. If you don't know the position of the value you want in the object, 
     but know the name of the key, you can access it like this:

     object.age 

     This would return the value 25 from our example object. Objects and arrays can get pretty wild, with arrays inside arrays, arrays inside objects and even 
     arrays inside objects inside bigger objects!
