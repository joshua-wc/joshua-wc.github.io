  <p>
      The idea that your brain is constantly rewiring itself to adapt to the needs of your circumstances is, i think, an incredibly useful bit of information. 
      Aside from the more obvious benefits it has for people in terms of their own personal advancement and strengthening of their skills, it does something 
      which I think is hugely important; it provides you an access point to your own world view and belief system, and gives you a way of understanding that 
      these things are also not fixed, but shaped by your environment. This is something I have only recently considered in my thoughts on neuroplasticity, 
      and the potential for personal growth and improvement in that area alone is significant. Being able to examine your world view (something which is 
      typically regarded as being nearly unshakeable) as something that is plastic and changeable will allow you to identify and eliminate prejudices you 
      maybe didn't realise you had, catch yourself practicing cognitive dissonance with regards to your values, and many other things. 
  </p>

  <p>
      For myself, music has always been a great practice for engaging my brain and keeping it flexible. And a lot of the other things that are cited as good 
      ways to improve your neuroplasticity are also things I enjoy a great deal (such as reading, travel, learning languages or even video games (yuss!)). 
      However, I think to a large degree neuroplasticity can be improved by doing almost anything consistently, especially if you engage with it as a process. 
      Cooking, gardening, and even (or maybe especially) just practicing good conversation with other people are always to engage your brain in diverse and 
      challenging ways. I found <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886" target="_blank">this article</a> very helpful in not only providing a 
      clear overview of these concepts, but also delineating between functional and structural plasticity.
  </p>

  <p>
      I was particularly struck by Carol Dweck's findings on growth vs fixed mindsets (and I'm a bit of a TED talk skeptic so I surprised myself here). The 
      idea that believing in your ability to improve was intrinsically linked to said ability was something that almost seemed like a cliche, but which I 
      already knew to be true. There is a pervading idea around the arts (my experience is in music but I'm sure it's the same in most other disciplines) that 
      being good at an instrument is an innate talent that some people have and others do not. Having been a student for many years (and continuing to be) as 
      well as a teacher, I'm adamant that this is not the case; anyone is capable of learning an instrument, if they are able to get past the idea in their own 
      head that they might not be able to do it. That being said, I found <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means" 
      target="_blank"> this article</a> by Dweck clarifying what was actually meant by growth mindset, and disspelling a few myths around it, particularly helpful; not only because 
      it recontextualised things in a professional environment, but also because it challenged my own belief that this was something I already possessed myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    That being said, I do think I've had some experience with these ideas in my learning practice already. Learning an instrument at university level is a very 
    intensive experience, and the only way you can survive with your self-esteem intact is to realise these kinds of things; that your brain is constantly 
    changing to reflect the skills you are telling it you need, and that your effort and hard work will always yield results, but especially if you believe 
    that it will. I hope to carry these ideas forward into my journey of learning programming, while strengthening my ability to identify and avoid pitfalls that 
    can come along with learning a whole new skillset, as well as integrating my personal growth journey into that.
