      So I got stuck on the second of a set of four problems that was testing our ability to make use of the built-in methods in Javascript (a method is 
      kind of like a tool that does a specific thing). The problem asked us to take a string (a word or sentence) and capitalise the first letter of every 
      word. It also told us specifically which methods to use in order to do this, and this was part of why I found myself blocked on this. Basically I 
      got caught up on the idea that there was a solution that only used the two methods mentioned, and was going crazy trying to understand how that could 
      be, as it didn't seem possible. I tried pseudocoding, I Googled frantically, and I asked my programmer friend for help. The solution I eventually arrived 
      at did still use both methods, but it also used some other methods that I had been avoiding because I thought there was another way. What I'd realised 
      was that I was adding the unnecessary context that since this was a test, there was a 'more correct' answer that I should have been looking for, instead 
      of going with my gut on a solution which worked (which would have led me to a solution much quicker).
    </p>

    <p>
      Conversely, the following day I sat down for some more coding challenges, and was able to solve one of them with a one line solution. This was that 
      efficiency I had been striving for earlier, and I'd actually done it! Something I had been doing is checking the sample solutions after I had finished 
      the problems, as a way of sating my curiosity about finding cleaner solutions. This was maybe what I found to be the most helpful thing I'd done so far, 
      as it answered some very specific questions that I had in a way that was much harder to acheive by Googling things. In particular I learned more clearly 
      how you could combine methods together into one line of code, and was able to implement that into a function which takes a sentence or word and reverses it; 
      a three step process that I was able to make happen in one line. It felt very rewarding, especially after the day before where I kept trying to do 
      something kind of similar and being met with constant errors.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've noticed my go to problem solving techniques is just to try something, and then read the error message to see what specifically it's referring to. 
      Making small tweaks to try and get different results usually allows me to zero in on the problem, but it can get frustrating if you don't get results for 
      a while. At this point I will usually turn to Google, and if that doesn't help, a peer. I tried a bit of pseudocoding and I do find it helpful if the 
      initial problem is overwhelming, but to be honest I often forget in my haste to plunge right in. One thing I found myself finally starting to utilise 
      was good old console.log; something I had been all but ignoring up until now was finally revealing itself to be incredibly helpful in revealing exactly 
      what was coming unstuck. And ultimately, stopping periodically and reflecting on the process is what helps me make these observations about myself, as well 
      as better absorb the knowledge I'm receiving. I would say at this point my main weakness is that I tend to do something resembling pseudocode and/or 
      rubber ducky largely in my head, which is definitely not an effective way of practicing these techniques.
