    Emotional intelligence is a person’s capability to empathise, to recognise emotional response in themselves and others, and to engage effectively on that emotional and purely social level. They’ve been referred to in this course as “soft skills”, as opposed to the “hard skills” of learning programming syntax or other technical aspects. Humans all have complex emotional identities which are coming into constant collision with the world and with other people, and being able to quantify the responses that arise from these emotional identities, and understand them, is both difficult and essential to navigating human social life effectively. And human social life is everywhere; every interaction, every enterprise, every transaction, and anything else that involves more than one person is inherently social. But even if you are doing something entirely alone, emotional intelligence is still important; because your emotional identity can collide with itself too, and being able to understand, rationalise and effectively manage those collisions and those internal emotional reactions is vital to maintaining a healthy mental outlook.

    This differs pretty dramatically from the notion of IQ, which is (in my opinion) a rather outdated method of quantifying intelligence that has arisen primarily from a Western capitalist notion of education and success. IQ is supposed to more reflect that “hard skills” proficiency, and covers things like analytical and critical thinking, knowledge acquisition, and memory retention. What’s maybe more interesting is where these two ideas intersect, and how that ties into our evolving notions of Intelligence. EQ and IQ are both parts of our general intelligence, which can be broadly categorized as an ability to perform a broad range of cognitive functions. AI provides a useful example to illustrate this idea; a chess-playing AI would not be considered to have general intelligence, as it can only play chess. In this way it has the same kind of hyper-specific intelligence as a calculator. Humans, on the other hand, have the neural flexibility to perform a broad range of tasks, and also to improve their cognitive capabilities with targeted practice.

    EQ can, in this way, also be improved, which may seem contrary to how a lot of people might view something of an emotional nature. But emotions are also the product of your mind in the same way that your analytical thoughts are, and your understanding of them can help you influence them and manage them to an extent. As I touched on above, this is important in many ways, but two major ones; it is critical for engaging in any collective enterprise (i.e. working at a company or on a project), and it is critical for being able to be alone with your own thoughts (particularly when you are engaging in something that is challenging your cognitive capabilities).
